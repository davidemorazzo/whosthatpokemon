#ANCHOR TO BE DONE
TODO Check patreon verification

TODO increased chance of shiny 1 in 300 guesses Patreon only
TODO shiny version only in the solution
TODO shiny rank like 1 shiny in 500 Pokémon then this can be added to the shiny leaderboard. Maybe we can have a button 
	like this ✨. So every 500th time you guess a shiny will appear (I will write a description for this) 
TODO Different languages free option where they can select which language of the bot they'd like to use (Only admin and owner). The bot 
	accepts answers in multiple languages
TODO refine gif scripts to add more gifs
TODO accept answer also without the attribute gmax, galar ...


TODO GIFS DATABASE
	X Save descriptions into a dataframe and try to parse the pokemon of correspondance
	X All the new gifs don't have the black version
	X Integrate the pokemon_data.csv with all the new pokemons
	X create another csv file only for descriptions with all the languages
	- add all of the unowns (A,B,C,D...)

TODO add command Wtp!shinyrecord or /shinyrecord This will show what shiny Pokémon they have got
	Please also add this button with the rest of the buttons which will be the shiny global leaderboard (✨)
TODO Pokémon to spawn every 10 minutes
