#ANCHOR TO BE DONE
TODO For the selecting generations can we also have Mega Pokémon an Gigantamax Pokemon as an option to add too. (For server owners and admins to change) patreon only
TODO Yes we would like more GIFs added to the bot ideally every single gif including the shiny versions. So we can do a shiny rank like 1 shiny in 500 Pokémon then this can be added 
	to the shiny leaderboard. Maybe we can have a button like this ✨
	So every 500th time you guess a shiny will appear (I will write a description for this) 

TODO I would like double points option for individual users and increased chance of shiny 1 in 300 guesses Patreon only
TODO Once I complete all the descriptions then I'm going to translate them to all major languages. I'd like this to be a free option where they can select which language of the bot 
	they'd like to use is that possible? (Only admin and owner) can change this. This will allow us to go worldwide. The bot can it accept answers in multiple languages?? So if we 
	did Pikachu in Italian or English or in any language both would work 
TODO refine gif scripts to add more gifs
TODO add points info on the New question embed
TODO Check patreon verification
